I have decided to move all entries on my personal blog related to software development over to my
[professional website](https://hovinen.tech). This puts my technical content in one place and makes
it easier to compose and manage my blog entries.

Going forward, I will only post non-technical articles on my personal blog.

In contrast to my Wordpress site, my professional blog does not offer functionality for user
comments. If you would like to comment on any blog entries, please feel free to
<a href="/#contact">reach out</a>.
